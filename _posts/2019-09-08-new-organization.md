We are now giving **Tree-of-Life** *(DISS)* a new image and place. For this, we are allocating the code and the whole documentation and website a new and dedicated GiHub organization, [TreeOfLife-diss](https://github.com/TreeOfLife-diss), where the project's code as well as the [webpage](https://treeoflife-diss.github.io/) are stored.

The original Tree-of-Life code (and first versions) continue to be hosted in [joaomcteixeira's repository](https://github.com/joaomcteixeira/Tree-of-Life). Though those are not maintained anymore and any further development will be made on the new repository.

Hope you find this new image more organize and appealing,
Best,

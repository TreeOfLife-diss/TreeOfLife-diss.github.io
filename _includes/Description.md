# Description

**Tree-of-Life** is a _stand-alone_ **library** written in [Python](www.python.org) that was designed to facilitate the installation of the dependencies required by **scientific software** which end users are mostly *non-developers* and to whom complex *terminal* operations may not be trivial. ToL reduces the task of installation and updating to simple *double-click* operations. Additionally, it provides a user-friendly interface to operate the installation process.

As the name implies, it provides a _tree_ of routines that give _life_ to your project (inside user's computers) `:-)`.

## Note

Tree-of-Life was initially developed to serve Python-dependent projects; for that reason, it can manage the installation of Python libraries that are required by the *host* project. However, Tree-of-Life can be extended (or branched to new projects) in the future to serve other languages or installation routines if needed. The following description focus on the current version.

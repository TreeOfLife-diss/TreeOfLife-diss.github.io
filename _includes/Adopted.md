# Projects which adopted Tree-of-Life

Hosting Tree-of-Life in a project does not prevent it being available through other sources, such as, Conda packages or PiPy. Some Scientific projects already use Tree-of-Life to manage their installation and updating routines:

- [Farseer-NMR](https://github.com/Farseer-NMR/FarSeer-NMR)
- [Tauren-MD](https://github.com/TaurenMD/TaurenMD)

# Vision

**Vocabulary:**
- the *host project* is that project that uses/implements/adapts/hosts Tree-of-Life for its benefit.
- *non-developer* users, are those users that lack programming/scripting skills.

## Aim

- Provide an independent and straightforward installer of Python-dependencies ([see note](#note)) for projects oriented to **non-developer** users.
- Encapsulate the whole installation (dependencies and software) within a single folder.
- Manage the configuration of the host project's executable files.
- Provide independent updating routines to keep the user's installation up to date.
- Be platform independent.
- Built to be easily implementable in host projects, either open or closed source, following the [LGPL 3 license](https://github.com/TreeOfLife-diss/TreeOfLife-diss/blob/master/LICENSE).
- Tree-of-Life is developed aiming mostly at scientific software but it can be extended to software packages any area of interest.
